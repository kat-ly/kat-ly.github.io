        THE RETURN OF THE ORACLE AS AI-BLACKBOX

        The AI oracle doesn’t create order in society from its margins. It is order, to be continually consulted and obeyed.

        The AI oracle’s immediacy and lack of context accords well with its new location – or better still locationlessness. Prophecies no longer come from the mouths of witches in the woods or a priestess on the cliffs of Delphi. They are pronounced constantly from all the computers that accompany and surround us – and, in the case of Alexa, inhabit our living rooms. The AI oracle doesn’t create order in society from its margins. It is order, to be continually consulted and obeyed.

    Insofar as we empower algorithms to work out everyday matters amongst themselves, the AI oracle does more than just speak. It acts for us.

        This is the already case with the playlists put together by Spotify and YouTube based on what we’ve previously heard and watched. It is one of the promises immanent to the Internet of Things and Smart City. At some point we will trust our refrigerators to order the right foods, having compared our preferences with our health data and, if necessary, consulted a nutritionist. At some point, even a refrigerator is nothing less than an oracle.

       The AI oracle occurs as a double paradox. It puts an end to free will in the interests of self-optimization. And it re-enchants the world – paradoxically by utilizing its absolute analyzability, for a world of unambiguous instructions about how to live with nary a verifiable basis is an enchanted one. It’s as though God were speaking to us through his new priests, the algorithms. Harari, too, writes of a “cosmic data-processing system” we serve with all the information we provide. It will be omnipresent and all-powerful. Human beings – this is how Harari’s history of tomorrow ends – are predestined to be dissolved within it. A digital pantheism, we might say, if that were not a whitewash (or “mathwash”) of all the bias and prejudice that determines what we input into the black box.
