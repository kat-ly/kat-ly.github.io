        The AI oracle doesn’t create order in society from its margins. It is order, to be continually consulted and obeyed.

        In his book Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, Yuval Noah Harari imagines the future of dating as a conversation between bots: “My Cortana may be approached by the Cortana of a potential lover, and the two will compare notes to decide whether it’s a good match – completely unbeknown to their human owners.” Just as human beings outsourced their memories to the written word and began to rely more on archived material than their own recollection, in the future they will trust that AI does a better job of processing important data than they ever will.

        Algorithms won’t enslave us, Harari postulates. Instead they will prove so good at making decisions that we would be crazy not to take their advice. He adds, “Once Google, Facebook and other algorithms become all-knowing oracles, they may well evolve into agents and ultimately into sovereigns.” We will not know why Cortana pairs us with this lover and not that one, but anyone who entrusts his life to AI by allowing it to drive a car should by all rights trust it to steer him through life. There is no doubting that algorithms can process much more data much more reliably than we can. And avoiding automobile and finding the perfect match are essentially matters of flawless data processing.

    With a classic oracle, you never knew which end was up. Even if you wanted to, you couldn’t blindly follow the oracle’s pronouncements. They required the recipient to engage in hermeneutics, to apply strange statements to his or her own concrete situation. The AI oracle Harari invokes overcomes individuals’ involvement in their own affairs. It doesn’t admonish “Know thyself,” as was written at the entrance to the oracle of Delphi. It does not encourage us to decode it. It simply says: Do as I say and don’t ask questions!

    <div class="text">
        The AI oracle’s immediacy and lack of context accords well with its new location – or better still locationlessness. Prophecies no longer come from the mouths of witches in the woods or a priestess on the cliffs of Delphi. They are pronounced constantly from all the computers that accompany and surround us – and, in the case of Alexa, inhabit our living rooms. The AI oracle doesn’t create order in society from its margins. It is order, to be continually consulted and obeyed.

    Insofar as we empower algorithms to work out everyday matters amongst themselves, the AI oracle does more than just speak. It acts for us.

        This is the already case with the playlists put together by Spotify and YouTube based on what we’ve previously heard and watched. It is one of the promises immanent to the Internet of Things and Smart City. At some point we will trust our refrigerators to order the right foods, having compared our preferences with our health data and, if necessary, consulted a nutritionist. At some point, even a refrigerator is nothing less than an oracle.
    </div>
    <div class="text">
       The AI oracle occurs as a double paradox. It puts an end to free will in the interests of self-optimization. And it re-enchants the world – paradoxically by utilizing its absolute analyzability, for a world of unambiguous instructions about how to live with nary a verifiable basis is an enchanted one. It’s as though God were speaking to us through his new priests, the algorithms. Harari, too, writes of a “cosmic data-processing system” we serve with all the information we provide. It will be omnipresent and all-powerful. Human beings – this is how Harari’s history of tomorrow ends – are predestined to be dissolved within it. A digital pantheism, we might say, if that were not a whitewash (or “mathwash”) of all the bias and prejudice that determines what we input into the black box.
